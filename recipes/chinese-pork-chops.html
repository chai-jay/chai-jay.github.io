<h1>Chinese Pork Chops</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2lb pork chops</li>
    <li>3/4 white onion</li>
    <li>3/4 red onion</li>
    <li>0.75 oz ginger</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>4 tbsp cornstarch</li>
    <li>3 tbsp cooking oil</li>
    <li>1.5 tsp garlic salt</li>
    <li>1.5 tbsp Shaoxing cooking wine</li>
    <li>
        <p id="marinade">Marinade:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp soy sauce (can use light soy sauce)</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp Shaoxing cooking wine</li>
            <li>3 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>0.75 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol class="steps-list">
    <li>Squeeze out excess moisture from pork chops and pat dry with paper towels. It will absorb the marinade better and not splatter as much when cooking.</li>
    <li>Tenderize the pork chops with mallet or back of your knife. If there are tendons/gray skin, give a couple cuts so they don't form a tough chewy strip after cooking.</li>
    <li>In a container large enough to marinade pork chops, mix the <a href="#marinade">marinade</a> ingredients well.</li>
    <li>Add tenderized pork to the container to marinade. Massage/squeeze the pork to work the marinade into the meat. Then let it marinade for at least 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mince garlic and julienne ginger into thin strips.</li>
    <li>Slice white and red onions into 1/4 inch thick strips. If desired, you can adjust size for whichever textures desired.</li>
    <li>Spread 4 tbsp cornstarch on a plate and then flip the pork chops in the cornstarch until they're gently covered with cornstarch. Shake off excess and set aside to get ready to cook.</li>
    <li>Heat cooking oil up in pan until it starts smoking/rippling. The oil should cover the bottom of pan. Turn heat down before adding pork chops to prevent uneven cooking.</li>
    <li>Add pork chops to the oil and turn heat back up to medium. Cook for 4-6 minutes until the bottom is caramelized/golden brown. Then flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Finally, flip for a second time and cook for another minute to ensure both sides are crispy.</li>
    <li>Push pork to the sides of the pan and add garlic, ginger, and onions. Toss and spread the aromatics around until fragrant. Then push to the bottom of the pan and lay the pork chops on top of the bed of aromatics.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle 1.5 tsp garlic salt on pork chops to taste and add 1.5 tbsp Shaoxing wine around the perimeter of the pan. Immediately cover the pan and turn the heat down. Let the onions cook down and everything steam together for 1-2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Give one last stir and serve with aromatics on the bottom and pork chops on top.</li>
</ol>
